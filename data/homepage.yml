  title: "How does Plug-In work?"
  content: "
  The PlugIn experience is made up of a big group of congregants, broken down into smaller groups of 6 to 15 people.

  Each of these small groups is led by a team of facilitators who have volunteered towards this cause to guide and engage participants
  in the course of their 10-week journey.
  
  The small groups meet once a week in Church, for two hours (between 9am-11am) to share and explore what they have studied 
  over a cup of tea and other refreshments. 

  There are 3 weekend activities that entail half day of prayer and fasting, sharing the gospel and serving the vulnerable and disadvantaged members of society.
  
  The experience culminates in a retreat at the tail end. 80% attendance is required for one to successfully complete the Plug-In experience."
